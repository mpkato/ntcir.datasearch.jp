The first round of Data Search focuses on the retrieval of a statistical data collection published by the Japanese government (e-Stat), 
and one published by the US government (Data.gov).
We will provide a set of topics derived from questions in a community question-answering service, 
queries generated by users based on the topics,
and relevance grades for a subset of the statistical data.
